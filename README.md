# TFG Sprite Editor for Godot
This project develops a free and open source tool for Godot, helping small studios to optimise their pipeline and reduce time. Since indies lack the resources for deep optimisations, this tool improves key processes. In the long term, the goal is for the community to adopt it and for it to be natively integrated into Godot.
